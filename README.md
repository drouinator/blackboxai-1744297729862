# Project Overview

This project involves a comprehensive verification system designed to check and report on the naming consistency of files within a specified directory structure. The primary aim is to ensure that files adhere to a predefined naming convention, which can be crucial for maintaining code quality and organization in software development.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://your-repo-url.git
   cd your-repo-directory
   ```

2. **Install dependencies** (if applicable):

   For JavaScript projects, use npm or yarn to install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   or 

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

## Usage

Once installed, you can run the naming verification script. Depending on your setup, you may need to adjust the paths or configurations in the scripts:

```bash
# Run the verification script
node scripts/verify_naming.js

# Or invoke any specific commands if provided
node backend/commands.js
```

Refer to the `backend/README.md` for detailed instructions on running backend scripts and the UI initialization process.

## Features

- **Naming Consistency Checking**: Automatically verifies if files follow the desired naming conventions.
- **Detailed Reporting**: Generates a comprehensive report summarizing verified files, those needing updates, and errors encountered during the check.
- **File Verification**: Verify multiple files across different directories, ensuring thorough coverage of your project structure.

## Dependencies

Based on the `package.json` files, the project depends on the following packages (exact packages and versions should be verified in the corresponding `package.json`):
